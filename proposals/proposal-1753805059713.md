The Fibonacci Sequence: History and Impact
The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones

## 📜 Origins

The sequence is named after **Leonardo of Pisa**, known as *Fibonacci*, who introduced it to Western mathematics in his 1202 book *Liber Abaci*. However, the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics.

Fibonacci used the sequence to model the growth of a hypothetical population of rabbits, under idealized assumptions.

## 🔢 Mathematical Definition

The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as:

- **F(0) = 0**
- **F(1) = 1**
- **F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)** for n > 1

## 🌻 Fibonacci in Nature

The sequence appears in various biological settings:

- The **arrangement of leaves** on a stem
- The **pattern of seeds** in a sunflower
- The **spiral shells** of mollusks
- The **reproduction pattern** of honeybees

These natural occurrences are related to **optimal packing** and **growth efficiency**.

## 🧠 Applications in Modern Fields

| Field            | Use of Fibonacci                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Computer Science** | Algorithms (e.g. Fibonacci heap, dynamic programming) |
| **Finance**           | Technical analysis using Fibonacci retracement      |
| **Art & Architecture** | Proportions based on the Golden Ratio (≈ 1.618)     |
| **Music**             | Rhythmic and structural composition patterns        |

## 🔗 The Golden Ratio

As the Fibonacci numbers increase, the ratio `F(n+1)/F(n)` approaches the **Golden Ratio (φ)**:


This ratio has been associated with aesthetics, appearing in nature, design, and classical architecture.

## 🧩 Fun Fact

A spiral built from Fibonacci-sized squares approximates the **Golden Spiral**, which is visually appealing and found in nature — like galaxies and hurricanes.

## 📝 Conclusion

The Fibonacci sequence is a beautiful example of how simple mathematics can explain complex and diverse phenomena, from **nature** to **finance**, **technology**, and **art**.
